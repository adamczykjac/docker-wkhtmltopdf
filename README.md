# Wkhtmltopdf Docker Container

This docker container lets you run wkhtmltopdf in a docker container.

## Building the image

```sh
docker build -t openlabs/docker-wkhtmltopdf .
```

## Using the image

```sh
docker run -v <host_dir>:<container_dir> openlabs/docker-wkhtmltopdf http://www.google.com <container_dir>/output.pdf
```

The mounted volume can be used to send local html files and to save
the output.

## Using as a service

If you are planning on using wkhtmltopsd as a service you might also be interested in
a downstream container which implements a HTTP API service that can be used to convert
HTML to PDF.
